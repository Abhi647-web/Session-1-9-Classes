        Akkineni Nageswara Rao (20 September 1924[1] – 22 January 2014), widely
        known as ANR, was an Indian actor and film producer, known for his work
        majorly in Telugu cinema. He starred in many landmark films in his
        seventy five-year career, and became one of the most prominent figures
        of Telugu cinema.[2] Akkineni received seven state Nandi Awards, five
        Filmfare Awards South and a Tamil Nadu State Film Award. The Highest
        Honour in Indian Cinema Dada Saheb Phalke Award was given on 38th

        (2011), Padma Bhushan (1988) and Padma Shri (1968), India's second,
        third and fourth highest civilian awards, for his contributions to the
        fields of Art and Cinema.[3][4][5] Akkineni is known for his work in
        biographical films. He portrayed the Tamil saint Vipra Narayana in the
        1954 film Vipra Narayana; Telugu poet Tenali Ramakrishna in the 1956
        film Tenali Ramakrishna, which received the All India Certificate of

        Chenchu Lakshmi (1958); Narada in Bhookailas (1958), and Arjuna in Sri
        Krishnarjuna Yuddhamu (1963). He is also remembered for his performances
        in romantic dramas Laila Majnu (1949), Devadasu (1953), Anarkali (1955),
        Batasari (1961), Mooga Manasulu (1964), Prema Nagar (1971),
        Premabhishekam (1981), and Meghasandesam (1982).[6][7] He also starred
        in the blockbusters Balaraju (1948), Keelu Gurram (1949), Ardhangi
        (1955), Donga Ramudu (1955), Mangalya Balam (1958), Gundamma Katha
        (1962), Doctor Chakravarty (1964), Dharma Daata (1970), and Dasara
        Bullodu (1971).[8][9] He was one of the instrumental figures in the
        shifting of the Telugu film industry from Madras to Hyderabad in the
        1970s.[10][11] He established Annapurna Studios in 1976 to provide
        infrastructural support to Telugu cinema in Hyderabad.[10] He later
        started the Annapurna International School of Film and Media within
        Annapurna Studios in 2011.[12] Manam (2014) was the last film of
        Akkineni, who died on 22 January 2014 during the film's production
        phase. Manam was featured at the 45th IFFI in the Homage to ANR section
        on 29 November 2014.[5] Early life and background Akkineni Nageswara Rao
        was born into a lower-middle-class family on 20 September 1924 in
        Ramapuram, Krishna District, of present-day Andhra Pradesh. He was the
        youngest of five brothers. His parents Akkineni Venkataratnam and
        Akkineni Punnamma,[13] were from the farming community. His formal
        education was limited to primary schooling due to his parents' poor
        economic condition. He began working in theatre at the age of 10.[14] He
        became a stage actor, specialising in playing female characters, since
        women at that time were mostly prohibited from acting. His most famous
        roles were in notable dramas Harishchandra, Kanakatara, Vipranarayana,
        Telugu Talli, Aasajyoti and Satyanveshanam. The turning point of his
        career was when Ghantasala Balaramayya, a prominent film producer at
        that time, discovered him at the Vijayawada railway station. He was cast
        in the lead role of Rama in Sri Seeta Rama Jananam (1944). This was
        after his debut in a supporting role in the film Dharmapatni (1941).
        Career He starred in over 255 films, spanning the Telugu, Tamil and
        Hindi languages.[15] A majority of his films were both commercial and
        critical successes.[3][16][4][5][17] Though he is known for playing
        mythological figures such as Rama and Krishna, he was notably an
        atheist.[18] He is fondly called Natasamrat by his fans. In 1953,
        Akkineni played the titular role in Devadasu (1953), which is based on
        the novel of the same name. Deccan Herald reported that several critics
        had considered Rao's portrayal to be the best among all language
        versions.[19] Navaratri (1966) made Akkineni the second actor after
        Sivaji Ganesan to play nine different roles in a film.[20] Akkineni is
        known for his romantic roles in films such as Laila Majnu (1949),
        Anarkali (1955), and Prema Nagar (1971). He also played several
        mythological characters in Mayabazar (1957), Mahakavi Kalidasu (1965),
        Bhakta Tukaram (1973), and Sri Ramadasu (2006).[21] Some of his many
        commercially successful films are Maya Bazaar, Samsaram, Bratuku
        Theruvu, Aradhana, Donga Ramudu, Dr. Chakravarthi, Ardhaangi, Mangalya
        Balam, Illarikam, Shantinivasam, Velugu Needalu, Dasara Bullodu, Bharya
        Bhartalu, Dharmadata, Batasari and College Bullodu. Sitaramayyagari
        Manavaralu was released in 1991, almost 50 years after his debut, and
        was a success at the box office. Akkineni played an instrumental role in
        shifting the base of Telugu cinema from Madras to Hyderabad. During the
        late 1970s, he made a point to work only in the films that were produced
        in Andhra Pradesh (except for Vijaya Vauhini Studios and Venus Studios
        films). In 1976, he established Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad as part
        of his efforts to provide the necessary infrastructure to produce films
        there.[22] Charity Akkineni was very active in social service. Regarding
        the existence of God, he once said, "If there's a presence there, I'm
        sure he'll want us to perform our earthly duties well and be a good
        human being rather than blindly worship him".[23] Akkineni set up the
        Akkineni Janmabhoomi trust under the Janmabhoomi programme to foster
        development in his home town, Ramapuram. He was instrumental in the
        construction of the Akkineni Varadhi (a bridge named after him), which
        improved his village's economy by facilitating easy connectivity. In
        Ramapuram, Akkineni contributed towards the construction of a water
        filtration plant.[24] He instituted the Akkineni International
        Foundation in 2005 to honour those who contributed to the Film
        Industry.[25] The Annapurna International School of Film and Media,
        founded by his family in 2011, was set up as a non-profit entity. Rao
        donated to educational institutions since the beginning of his career
        and created scholarships at GITAM University (Vizag).[26] He was the
        Chief Donor and President of Akkineni Nageswara Rao College, which was
        named after him.[27] Rao was a Life member of the board and an adviser
        to the Department of Dramatics and Theatre Arts of Andhra University. He
        instituted gold medals for students who excelled in Acting and
        Direction.[28] In 2012, he instituted the Akkineni Annapurna Educational
        Trust in memory of his wife Annapurna.[29] Personal life Further
        information: Akkineni–Daggubati family Akkineni married Annapurna on 18
        February 1949. Annapurna Studios (established 1975) is named after her,
        and she was also credited as a presenter for several of the studio's
        productions. Annapurna died in 2011 after a prolonged illness.[30] The
        couple had 5 children: Nagarjuna, Venkat Rathnam, Saroja, Sathyavathi,
        and Naga Susheela. Death On 19 October 2013, Akkineni was diagnosed with
        stomach cancer.[31] He continued shooting for his final film Manam two
        weeks after a major laparoscopic surgery, which some doctors feared he
        wouldn't survive.[32] His last public appearance was at the foundation
        day celebrations of Annapurna Studios on 14 January 2014. Akkineni died
        a week later, on 22 January 2014.[33] He was cremated on 23 January
        2014, at Annapurna Studios with full state honours amid a 21-gun salute.
        Thousands were present to pay their last respects.[34][35] Awards and
