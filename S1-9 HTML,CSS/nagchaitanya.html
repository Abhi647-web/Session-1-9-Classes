      owner of the cloud kitchen chain Shoyu and is a celebrity endorser for
      numerous brands and products. He was married to actress Samantha Ruth
      Prabhu from 2017 to 2021.[4] Early life and family Chaitanya with
      Nagarjuna and Amala Chaitanya was born on 23 November 1986 in Hyderabad to
      actor Akkineni Nagarjuna and Lakshmi Daggubati.[5][6][7] His paternal
      grandfather, actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao and his maternal grandfather,
      producer D. Ramanaidu are prominent figures in Telugu cinema.[8]
      Chaitanya's parents got divorced when he was a child. Both his parents
      later remarried. While Nagarjuna married former actress Amala Mukherjee,
      Lakshmi married Sharath Vijayaraghavan, a corporate executive at Sundaram
      Motors.[9] Chaitanya has a paternal half-brother, actor Akhil Akkineni[10]
      and a maternal step brother.[9] His maternal uncle Venkatesh and first
      cousins Rana Daggubati, Sumanth and Sushanth are also actors.[11]
      Chaitanya grew up in Chennai, where he was raised for 18+1⁄2 years.[12] He
      was educated at Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan, Chennai[13] and at AMM School,
      Chennai.[13] He then completed his graduation from St. Mary's College,
      Hyderabad.[14] He expressed his desire to Nagarjuna to take up acting as
      his profession during his second year in college.[15] He enrolled in a
      three-month acting course in Mumbai. He received further training in
      acting and martial arts in Los Angeles, apart from taking voice and
      dialogue coaching for one year before making his acting debut.[16][17]
      Career Debut and breakthrough (2009–2012) Chaitanya debuted in 2009 with
      the film Josh, directed by Vasu Varma, in which he played a college
      student.[18] Rediff.com wrote: "As a debutant, Naga Chaitanya has
      performed well. He has his moments where he's proven himself. There is
      always scope for improvement and one hopes that he will hone his skills in
      the years to come."[19] Chaitanya won the Filmfare Award for Best Male
      Debut - South.[20] He next starred in the 2010 romantic drama Ye Maaya
      Chesave, directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon, which was simultaneously shot
      in Tamil as Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, with a different cast and
      climax.[21] He played a Hindu Telugu assistant director who falls in love
      with a Christian Malayali girl. A reviewer from Sify.com wrote: "Naga
      Chaitanya is at home in romantic scenes. His asset is his voice and his
      casual acting style. Chaitanya has improved his performance from his first
      film. He can now confidently act in more romantic films and strengthen his
      position." However, the reviewer felt that he should concentrate on his
      looks as he felt that Chaitanya looked "very boyish".[22] The film was a
      success at the box office and went on to receive a cult status.[15][23] He
      also received a nomination for Filmfare Award South for Best Actor
      Male.[24][25]
