      for the Telugu Warriors in the inaugural Celebrity Cricket League (CCL) in
      2011. Since then he has regularly participated in the CCL tournament,
      winning the 2016 edition as captain of his team.[7] Career As an infant,

      drama, Manam (2014), directed by Vikram Kumar. It featured three
      generations of actors from the Akkineni family. His cameo in the climax of
      the film was an instant rage with the audience.[9] He described his shoot
      for the film alongside his grandfather, father and half-brother, as
      "nervous and exciting".[10] Manam went on to become one of the most
      profitable Telugu films of 2014, whilst also considered to be one of the
      greatest Telugu films of all-time. Critics dubbed the film a "classic"
      en-route to it winning several awards, including Best Film at the Filmfare
      Awards.[11][12] He subsequently went on to make appearances in several

      despite garnering generally positive reviews.[16] Following that, Akhil's
      third film was Mr. Majnu (2019), directed by Venky Atluri and co-starring
      Niddhi Agerwal.[17] Despite a great pre-release buzz and successful album,
      it opened to mixed reviews upon release. It eventually bombed
      commercially, becoming Akhil's third consecutive failure. In October 2021,
      his fourth film, the rom com, Most Eligible Bachelor was released. It
      co-starred Pooja Hegde and was directed by Bommarillu and Parugu fame,
      Bhaskar. It was produced by Bunny Vas and Vasu Varma, under GA2.[18] It
      became a hit and gave Akhil a long-awaited box office success.[19] Akhil's
      next film, Agent, directed by Surender Reddy and produced by Anil Sunkara,
      released on April 28, 2023. It was made on a huge budget of 80 crores.
      However, upon release, it received highly negative reviews from both the
      critics and audience, alike. It had an extremely low opening and was a
      commercial disaster.[20]
