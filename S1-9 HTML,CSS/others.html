      Yarlagadda Sumanth Kumar (born 9 February 1975), known mononymously as
      Sumanth, is an Indian actor who works predominantly in Telugu cinema. He
      is the eldest grandson of Telugu actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao. He is also
      a partner in Annapurna Studios.[1] Sumanth's most notable films are Prema
      Katha (1999),[2] Yuvakudu (2000), Satyam (2003),[3]Gowri (2004),[4]
      Godavari (2006), Madhumasam (2008), Golconda High School (2011), Malli
      Raava (2017), and Sita Ramam (2022). Background and early life Sumanth was
      born in Hyderabad, India, on 9 February 1975.[5][6] He is the only son of
      Surendra Yarlagadda and Satyavathi Akkineni. He is the eldest grandchild
      of the Telugu film actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao. A few months after his
      birth, Sumanth's parents returned to the US where they were residing.
      Sumanth, however, remained in India on the request of his grandfather
      Akkineni Nageswara Rao, who was then on a hiatus from films after a major
      heart surgery. The latter had often said that his busy acting career
      prevented him from fully experiencing fatherhood with his own children, so
      he wished to raise his first grandchild himself. Subsequently, Sumanth was
      adopted by his maternal grandparents.[7] Family Sumanth's father, Surendra
      Yarlagadda, is a former film producer, noted for several hit films such as
      Muchataga Mugguru (1985), Collector Gari Abbayi (1987), Rao Gari Illu
      (1988), Siva (1989), and Gaayam (1993). He has one younger sister: Supriya
      Yarlagadda, who is the executive director of Annapurna Studios. Actor
      Nagarjuna Akkineni is his maternal uncle.[8] Actors Naga Chaitanya, Akhil
      Akkineni, and Sushanth are his cousins.[9] In August 2004, Sumanth married
      former actress Keerthi Reddy. They were divorced amicably in 2006.[10]
      Education Sumanth studied at the Hyderabad Public School, graduating in
      1991. For his undergraduate studies, he enrolled in an engineering course
      in Michigan. Realising after two years that it wasn't in his best
      interest, he transferred to Columbia College Chicago, from where he
      graduated with a B. A. in Film Studies in 1997.[11] Acting career Sumanth
      made his debut as a lead actor in Ram Gopal Varma's Prema Katha in
      1999.[12][13] Although not commercially successful ,[14] the film was
      critically acclaimed and received five Nandi awards, including the Nandi
      Award for Best Feature Film.[15] Even though it was just an average earner
      when released, his second film Yuvakudu (2000) directed by Karunakaran
      would go on to be widely considered an underrated film later on .[16][17]
      Sumanth’s lean box office run continued with his next films Pelli
      Sambandham, Ramma Chilakamma, and Snehamante Idera, despite popular actors
      from his family Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Nagarjuna sharing screen in two
      of them.[18] Sumanth’s box office breakthrough came in late 2003 with
      Satyam (2003 film)[19] where he played the role of a struggling lyricist.
      In addition to commercial success, Sumanth received critical acclaim, with
      Idlebrain.com commenting, "there is not even a single moment where you can
      find any shortcomings in his histrionics".[20] This was followed by
      another hit Gowri in 2004. This action drama was a remake of the Tamil
      film Thirumalai. Idlebrain.com Jeevi wrote, “Sumanth was good as usual and
      performed really well in fights”.[21] After consecutive hits, he continued
      in the action genre with Dhana 51 (2005), which was a flop, and the
      average running Mahanandi (2006).[22][23] Sumanth altered his path in
      2006, starring in Sekhar Kammula's Godavari, which remains one of the most
      acclaimed films in his career. On top of immense critical and commercial
      success, this film also garnered five Nandi awards and a Filmfare
      award.[24] Rediff.com said that Godavari is “a film that reminds us that
      cinema can be so much more ”.[25] Sumanth next acted in Chinnodu, which
      released in October 2006 and was an average grosser.[26] In 2007, he
      starred in the romantic drama Madhumasam, produced by D. Ramanaidu and
      directed by Chandra Siddhartha. This film was a hit, having a 100 days
      theatrical run.[27] Sumanth next did the lead in Classmates, which
      generated a curiosity as it was the first time that its director K. Vijaya
      Bhaskar was without his usual collaborator Trivikram Srinivas as dialogue
      writer.[28] Additionally, it was a remake of the trend-setting Malayalam
      film Classmates.[29] Despite positive reviews, the film however failed at
      the box office. Sumanth’s next two films were Pourudu (2008), which was a
      moderate success,[30] and Boni (2009) which was a failure.[31] Sumanth's
      following film Golconda High School in 2011 was a sports drama directed by
      Mohana Krishna Indraganti. Based on an English Novel "The Men Within"
      written by Harimohan Paruvu, an ex Ranji Trophy cricketer,[32] this film
      was positively reviewed and was well received by audiences. Idlebrain.com
      said that Sumanth's role as a cricket coach was his "career best
      performance".[33] This was followed by failures like Raaj (2011),
      Daggaraga Dooranga (2011), Emo Gurram Egaravachu (2014) and Naruda
      Donoruda (2016).[34][35][36][37] Among these, Naruda Donoruda was
      anticipated as it was a remake of the Bollywood hit Vicky Donor. The film
      however received disappointing reviews, and its theatrical run was further
      negatively affected by the coinciding 2016 Indian banknote
      demonetisation.[38][39] Sumanth made a comeback in late 2017 with the
      romantic drama Malli Raava, under the direction of debutant Gowtam
      Tinnanuri. This film was a box office hit and was well reviewed,[40][41]
      with Firstpost calling it “a pleasant surprise” and "Sumanth's best film
      in a long time".[42] It won four awards including best film from the
      Telugu Chamber of Film and Commerce.[43] Sumanth next played the lead role
      in Subrahmanyapuram (2018). This mystery thriller was commercially an
      average runner after receiving mixed reviews.[44] It was followed by the
      flop Idam Jagath (2018). Sumanth then played the lead role in
      Kapatadhaari, which was a remake of the Kannada Neo-noir Thriller
      Kavaludaari. This film released in February 2021 with 50% theatre
      occupancy COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and turned out to be commercially
      unsuccessful despite positive reviews.[45][46] His next film Malli
      Modalaindi (2021) released directly on OTT to negative reviews.[47]
      However, the popular website Greatandhra.com called it a “soft hit” based
      on streaming hours.[48] The various supporting and cameo roles Sumanth did
      starting from 2019 received a positive response. Despite the film’s
      commercial failure, Sumanth's supporting role as his grandfather Akkineni
      Nageswara Rao was well received in NTR: Kathanayakudu.[49] In 2022, he did
      a key supporting role in the film Sita Ramam, a war romance starring
      Dulquer Salmaan. This film was a major commercial and critical success and
      Sumanth's performance received appreciation.[50] He then appeared in an
      integral cameo role in the Dhanush starrer Vaathi (2023) which was also
      successful.[51][52]
